# TSL Textures


## Image Licence
	
	
You can use TSL textures to generate images for textures. You are allowed:

* **to freely use the images** in anything: web sites, publications, presentations, printed materials, company logos, billboards, games, movies, adverticements;
* **to modify, adapt and build** on the images in any imaginable way;
* **to release your work** with the images under any licence of your choice.


However, we hope that:
	
* the images are not used in any immoral, illegal, misleading or diceptive context;
* you understand that anyone could recreate the exact same images, that you have already created with pasion and love;
* you find this software useful.


## Software Licence
	
The software for TSL textures is licenced under
[MIT licence](https://github.com/boytchev/tsl-textures?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme).
